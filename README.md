# Groundwork Pocket Guide

## Running Commands

When given a command to run, make sure to include every character in that command, which is shown in `this font`.

**However**, `<>` indicate parts of the command that you should replace with whatever is specified. For instance, when instructed to run `git clone <ADDRESS-OF-GIT-REPOSITORY>`, the command that you should actually run should look something like `git clone git@github.com:allegheny-college-expressioneers/groundwork-lab-mariakimheinert.git`.

## How To Set Up A New SSH Key

To establish SSH key-based authentication between a local computer (JupyterLab) and a remote computer (GitHub):

1. On the local computer, create a new SSH key by running `ssh-keygen`.
2. Copy the **public key**, denoted by the `.pub` extension, that you generated by using the command `cat ~/.ssh/<NAME-OF-PUBLIC-KEY>` and copying its output. If you accept the default settings for `ssh-keygen`, this key will be named `id_rsa.pub`.
3. Add the **public** key (e.g. `id_rsa.pub`) to your GitHub account by clicking on the down arrow next to your profile photo in the top-right corner and going to **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys** > **New SSH key**.

## Basic Terminal Commands

**Examples** assume working directory is `groundwork-lab-<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>`

## How To Copy, or **Clone**, An Assignment To JupyterLab Using Git

1. On the GitHub repository page for the assignment, click the green **Code** button, make sure the **SSH** option is selected, and copy the link to your clipboard.
2. On JupyterLab, in a terminal, run `cd ~` to navigate into your home directory, then run `git clone <ADDRESS-OF-GIT-REPOSITORY>`. E.g. `git clone git@github.com:allegheny-college-expressioneers/groundwork-lab-mariakimheinert.git`.

## How To Track Your Changes For An Assignment Using Git

If you have not yet set your Git username and email on JupyterLab, run the following commands:

```
git config --global user.email "<YOUR-GITHUB-EMAIL>"
git config --global user.name "<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>"
```

1. On JupyterLab, navigate into the repository, then run `git add .`.
2. Run `git commit -m "<A-ONE-LINE-DESCRIPTION-OF-THE-CHANGES>"`. E.g. `git commit -m "Add ranking of Marvel Chrises"`.

## How To Push Your Tracked Changes For An Assignment To GitHub Using Git

1. On JupyterLab, navigate into the repository, then run `git push`.

**Remember to track and push your changes on JupyterLab frequently. Like, every time you make a change. You are responsible for backing up your work to GitHub in case JupyterLab goes down.**
